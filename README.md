# audiotest-2
Template for University of Salford MSc Audio Production students to adapt to host comparative audio tests online. This project supersedes a version 1 with “self-hosted” video & limited browser support. It uses an embedded video player from Vidyard for wider browser compatibility.

To use this template the following additional actions are required as a minimum:

1. An account with Vidyard https://www.vidyard.com to which to upload your video file or files with multiple audio tracks.
2. You will then need to follow their support documentation at https://knowledge.vidyard.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010001713-Embed-your-video-on-a-webpage on enabling embed for the videos you’ve uploaded. Note that a maximum of 5 videos can be enabled for embed on a free Vidyard account. You should choose the “inline” embed option.
3. You will need to edit each page of html (one per test page, see point 5 below) to replace the code there currently (which references a short test video with Vidyard) to the code copied in step 2 above.
4. When the php files are performing their function they e-mail test results to an address “hard written” into the code of the files. Currently placeholder address "you@edu.salford.ac.uk" is used, this will need to be edited to the test owner's e-mail address. At time of writing there is some doubt that a "@edu.salford.ac.uk" will work & it may be necessary to use a personal mail.
5. For each additional test page you will need differently named copies of index.html & form2mail.php. One example copy of each is included in this repository, with the copy pages named page2.html & form2mail2.php respectively. In addition to renaming the copied html file(s) & editing them to reference different video files, you will need to edit the "action" on the form included, so the test results are sent to the corresponding php file. You will need to edit the php file so the e-mail it sends has a different subject (p1, p2, p3 etc) so you can tell which e-mail received relates to which test page. You will need to edit the link on the php page which takes you to the next page of the test (or back to the beginning, on the final page of the test).
6. The php file (& any additional php files you create) need to be hosted on a machine running PHP (e.g. a web server) to perform its function. You could test and develop the function of the html, css & js files hosting these locally, but the functionality that follows pressing “Submit” on the index page will not work. See University Service Portal Knowledge article https://salfordprod.service-now.com/sp?id=search&q=KB0010645 for information on University provided hosting accounts.
7. Consideration should be given to GDPR regulation, despite the very small amount of data being collected (name of subject) in running the test. You might consider removing the text input field for name from the test to anonymise it, removing personal data fom the test, but as the page wil be hosted on the net & searchable & accessible to anyone this runs the risk of random & possibly unreliable results.
